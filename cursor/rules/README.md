## How to Use These Rules

1. Review all rule files to understand the project standards
2. Apply these standards in your daily development work
3. Reference specific rule files during code reviews
4. Suggest updates to rules when better approaches are identified

## Contributing to Rules

If you want to propose changes to any rule:

1. Discuss the proposed change with the team
2. Create a pull request with the specific change
3. Provide justification for the rule update
4. Get approval from at least two team members before merging

Remember that these rules exist to improve consistency and maintainability, not to restrict innovation. If a rule is getting in the way of creating better code, it should be reconsidered.
